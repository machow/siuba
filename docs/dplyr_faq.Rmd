# For dplyr users

Below is a list of surprising cases people coming from dplyr might hit.


## Why did you choose `>>` and not `%>%`

Unfortunately, `%>%` is not valid python syntax. The [operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/3.7/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence) for `>>` is not too bad!


## How do I use something like n_distinct in siuba?

Many of the "missing" dplyr functions can be found in the `siuba.dply.vector` module.
Oftentimes, you can find an analogous function in pandas, though. In this case, `nunique`.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from siuba.dply.vector import n_distinct
from siuba import _, summarize

# Two ways on a series
ser = pd.Series(['a', 'a', 'b'])

n_distinct(ser)
ser.nunique()
```

```{python}
# used in siuba
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'somecol': ser
    })

# Two ways using summarize
# n_distinct
summarize(df, n = n_distinct(_.somecol))

# nunique
summarize(df, n = _.somecol.nunique())
```

## My column name is also a pandas method

When a column has the same name as a method, you can't get it using attribute access.
If you try, pandas will give you the function instead.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
from siuba import _, summarize

df = pd.DataFrame({'sum': [1,2,3]})   
df.sum.sum()
```

To work around this you can use indexing to access the column.

```{python}
df['sum'].sum()
```

The same applies to siuba!

```{python}
summarize(df, ttl = _['sum'].sum())
```

(In the future, siuba can fix this pandas issue to behave more like R, so that attribute access and calling a method are treated differently)

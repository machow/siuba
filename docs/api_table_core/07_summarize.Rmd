## Summarize

This function lets you define a new column in your data, which is a single number calculated either across all the data, or within specified groups. It will result in a DataFrame with as many rows as the number of unique groups, or if no groups are defined, one row.

```{python}
from siuba import _, group_by, summarize
from siuba.data import mtcars
```

### Summarize over everything

When you use summarize with an ungrouped DataFrame, the result is a single row.

```{python}
mtcars >> summarize(avg_mpg = _.mpg.mean())
```

### Summarizing per group

When you use summarize with a grouped DataFrame, the result has the same number of rows as there are groups in the data. For example, there are 3 values of cylinders (`cyl`) a row can have (4, 6, or 8), so the result will be 3 rows.

```{python}
(mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(avg_mpg = _.mpg.mean())
  )
```

Note that summarize also accepts a single value, like a string or number.

```{python}
(mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(
       measure = "mean miles per gallon",
       value = _.mpg.mean()
       )
  )
```

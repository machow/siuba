# Introduction to siuba

Siuba is a tool for concise, flexible data-analysis over multiple data sources. It currently supports pandas DataFrames and SQL tables.


```{python}
from siuba import _, group_by, summarize, filter
from siuba.data import mtcars

(mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(avg_hp = _.hp.mean())
  )
```

The siuba library has 3 main goals:


* **concise** - simplify using pandas methods on columns of data, with siu expressions (e.g. `_.somecol.mean()`).
* **flexible** - ensure that any operations can run on either grouped or ungrouped data.
* **multiple data sources** - allow a chain of operations (called a pipe) to work with pandas and SQL data.


## Consice pandas operations with siu expressions (`_`)

```{python}
# old approach
mtcars[lambda _: _.cyl == 4]

# siu approach
mtcars[_.cyl == 4]
```

```{python}
# old approach
mtcars.assign(cyl2 = lambda _: _.cyl*2)

# siu approach
mtcars.assign(cyl2 = _.cyl*2)
```

```{python}
# siu approach
mtcars \
  .groupby("cyl") \
  .apply((_.mpg / _.cyl).mean())
```

Note that using siu expressions is not limited to pandas.
At its core, a siu expression just generates a function that can be called, similar to a `lambda` function.

```{python}
# using a lambda
f_lambda = lambda _: _ + _

# using siu expression
f = _ + _

f(1)
```

The one exception is that if a siu expression needs to access an attribute, then you need to escape it with two tildes.


```{python}
class AThing:
    x = 1
    
    @staticmethod
    def print_hey():
        print("hey")

# produces 1
AThing.x

# calling a method doesn't need to be escaped
f_hey = _.print_hey()
f_hey(AThing)
```

```{python}
# operations that don't end in attribute access are fine!
f_add = _.x + _.x
f_add(AThing)
```

```{python}
# ending with attribute access needs to be escaped
f_x = ~~_.x

f_x(AThing)
```

## Flexible in handling grouped and ungrouped data

One major challenge when working with pandas is that many methods which exist on an ungrouped DataFrame, do not exist on a grouped DataFrame. To illustrate, below are the methods shown above.

* `mtcars[_.cyl == 4]`
* `mtcars.assign(cyl2 = _.cyl*2)`
* `mtcars.groupby('cyl').apply(...)`

The first two methods (indexing with `[` and assign) only work with ungrouped data. In the last method chain, `apply` works different depending whether data is grouped or not.

**(TODO: finish describing apply case)**


**TODO: review simple uses of the verbs filter, summarize, mutate. For now, see core one table verbs section of docs**


## Works seamlessly with pandas and SQL

Up to this point we've covered how siuba simplifies column operations using siu expressions (`_`), and a pipe of table verbs to flexibly handle both grouped and ungrouped data. A major benefit of these two approaches is that they allow us to change how siuba behaves depending on the data source on which it is operating.

This is shown below, where we perform an operation from earlier in the docs to a sqlite table.

```{python}
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from siuba.sql import LazyTbl

# # copy in to sqlite
engine = create_engine("sqlite:///:memory")
mtcars.to_sql("mtcars", engine, if_exists = "replace")

# connect with siuba
tbl_mtcars = LazyTbl(engine, "mtcars")

(tbl_mtcars
  >> group_by(_.cyl)
  >> summarize(avg_hp = _.hp.mean())
  )
```
